# Day 027 - Using Twilio for SMS 

The purpose of this day is to have fun communicating via SMS (and with the help of `twilio`!). We will utilize twilios server to handle post and get requests, to create a dad joke generator!
### Variables and Strings



### Your Task:

1. After you finish reading through this guide, visit the documentation to get an understanding how to use things

2. Install all dependencies:
    ```
    pip install bs4
    pip install pandas
    https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
    ^ if you do not have pip installed on machine
    ```

3. create 3 functions:
* One that gets the roster of a team
* Two that get different types of stats
* Convert to csv file (Extra credit)

We will be using https://www.sports-reference.com/ for sports stats. They allow web scraping and have very easy-to-follow web elements.

Good luck and happy coding!
